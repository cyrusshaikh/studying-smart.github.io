    modelAnswer: "Boo Radley becomes the subject of the children’s fascination and imaginative games. They are both fearful of him and curious, based on town gossip and superstition. The rumors make Boo seem monstrous, but their fascination reflects how easily people can misunderstand and isolate those who are different. Boo represents a symbol of 'the unknown other' — someone the town fears but doesn’t truly know. As the children grow, their views of Boo begin to mature, reflecting their own moral development and the novel's theme of empathy.",
