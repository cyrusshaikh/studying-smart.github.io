    <h2>📖 Chapters 1–3 Summary</h2>

    <h3>📘 Chapter 1: “Making Me”</h3>
<p>Chapter 1 begins with Archibald McCandless’s memoir, which includes ornate illustrations attributed to artist William Strang. These visuals accompany anatomical references and character portraits, lending the book the aesthetic of a medical text crossed with a Gothic novel. Footnotes by Alasdair Gray annotate the narrative, often with historical or architectural trivia about 19th-century Glasgow.</p>

<p>McCandless recounts his humble origins in Galloway, a rural region in southwest Scotland. Born as the illegitimate son of a poor farmer, he grows up on the fringes of respectability. Before her death, his mother entrusts him with her life savings, allowing him to pursue medical studies at Glasgow University. However, his social status marks him as an outsider. His classmates look down on his worn-out clothing and provincial manner.</p>

<p>Despite this, McCandless proves resourceful. He purchases a decent microscope and some new shirts, small but significant changes that elevate how others perceive him. Among all his peers, only one man earns his full respect—Godwin Baxter, a fellow student who stands out for entirely different reasons.</p>

<p>Godwin is a medical prodigy, but more importantly, he becomes the axis around which the rest of McCandless’s story—and indeed the novel—will spin.</p>


    <h3>📘 Chapter 2: “Making Godwin Baxter”</h3>
   <p>This chapter is devoted entirely to the character of Godwin Baxter, a man who is both grotesque and brilliant. McCandless describes him vividly: a towering figure with an abnormally large face and stout limbs, yet possessing a high-pitched, almost childlike voice. Baxter is the son of the late Sir Colin Baxter, a respected doctor. Though born out of wedlock, Godwin was later legitimized by his father—a symbolic contrast to McCandless, whose own father never acknowledged him.</p>

<p>Godwin’s life has been far from ordinary. Raised and educated entirely by his father, he was molded into a living science project. By the age of six, he could monitor his own temperature, analyze his urine and blood, and diagnose his health. He was never given a normal childhood—only training in what Sir Colin deemed "medically useful." His social development suffered, and his eerie appearance frightened patients to the extent that he could not graduate with a traditional medical degree. Instead, he focused on medical research, isolated from the public but driven by a mind that never stops experimenting.</p>

<p>McCandless and Godwin begin taking long walks together, debating medical ethics and hospital reform. During one of these conversations, Godwin cryptically mentions his birth: he believes he came into the world as a result of Sir Colin’s “dealings with a nurse.” Whether literal or metaphorical, this statement adds to the mystery surrounding him.</p>

<p>Godwin also reveals that he suffers from a chemical imbalance, one that requires constant testing and fine-tuned treatments. More disturbing is his candid mention of vivisections—operations on living animals—performed by his father, which he discusses with unsettling nonchalance.</p>


    <h3>📘 Chapter 3: “The Quarrel”</h3>
<p>Godwin invites McCandless to his home, where the tone shifts from strange to outright uncanny. He presents two live rabbits, each bisected perfectly: one half black, the other half white. Initially baffled, McCandless soon realizes the truth—Godwin has surgically sliced and reassembled them. The rabbits have literally been sewn back together in mismatched halves.</p>

<p>Rather than recoiling in horror, McCandless is thrilled. He imagines a world where such surgical feats could be used to perform human transplants, save lives, and change the future of medicine. But Godwin quickly tempers this excitement. He argues that the true solution to illness lies not in cutting-edge surgery, but in public health reforms—clean housing, nutritious food, and environmental safety. He believes that without tackling the social causes of illness, medicine is just a bandage over a gaping wound.</p>

<p>McCandless, more of an idealist when it comes to science, disagrees. He believes that systemic reform is impossible in a capitalist Britain that profits from inequality. This ideological clash erupts into a full-blown argument. Godwin, angered and disappointed, asks McCandless to leave.</p>

<p>Desperate to stay in his good graces, McCandless begs for permission to publish Godwin’s research. Godwin refuses. The secrets he holds are not yet ready—or perhaps not safe—for public eyes.</p>

 
<h2>🔍 Analysis & Interpretation</h2>

<h4>📚 Framing and Fictionality</h4>
<p>From the outset, <em>Poor Things</em> presents itself not merely as a story, but as a puzzle about authorship, memory, and credibility. The fictional “discovery” of the manuscript and the debate between Donnelly and Gray invites readers to question everything: Is McCandless telling the truth? Is Victoria lying? Or is this entire narrative a parable for something deeper?</p>

<p>This metafictional structure is critical. It echoes works like <em>Frankenstein</em> and <em>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em>, where layers of narration blur the line between fact and myth. Gray asks us not just to read the story, but to examine who is telling it, why, and what power that gives them.</p>

<h4>⚖️ Science vs. Society</h4>
<p>The early chapters pit two visions of progress against each other: McCandless’s excitement about technological innovation and Godwin’s radical insistence on social reform. McCandless sees miracles in the laboratory; Godwin sees futility without justice and equity. This mirrors ongoing real-world debates about whether medicine should focus on cutting-edge treatments or root causes like poverty and pollution.</p>

<h4>🧠 Godwin as Gothic Figure</h4>
<p>Godwin Baxter is a modern-day Frankenstein figure—created, shaped, and alienated by science. His grotesque appearance and medical genius make him both a monster and a visionary. His character serves as a critique of how Victorian medicine often dehumanized both patients and practitioners, turning people into case studies or experiments.</p>

<h4>👥 Theme of Legitimacy</h4>
<p>Legitimacy—both biological and social—is a running thread. McCandless is illegitimate in the eyes of society, as is Godwin. But while McCandless yearns for acceptance, Godwin seems to reject it. Their shared outsider status creates a fragile kinship, but also deep differences in worldview.</p>

<h4>🧪 Moral Gray Areas</h4>
<p>The rabbit experiment is not just a grotesque image—it is an ethical lightning rod. It forces the reader to ask: Is science inherently good? Do ends justify means? And who decides what kind of experimentation is acceptable?</p>
