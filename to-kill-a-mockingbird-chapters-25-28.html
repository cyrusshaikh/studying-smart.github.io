<strong>Chapter 25</strong>
The chapter opens with Scout observing a roly-poly bug, tempted to squash it before Jem stops her, comparing the bug to the mockingbird: harmless and undeserving of harm. This image echoes the novel’s central moral symbol.

Scout reflects on Dill’s account of the night when Atticus and Calpurnia visited the Robinsons to deliver the news of Tom’s death. According to Dill, Helen collapsed before even hearing the full news, intuitively sensing her husband's fate — an image likened to the crushing of an insect.

Maycomb quickly moves on from Tom’s death, showing how normalized Black suffering has become. Only Mr. Underwood publicly mourns the tragedy in an editorial, comparing Tom’s death to the "senseless slaughter of songbirds." Bob Ewell, however, ominously declares, “one down and about two more to go,” hinting at further violence.

<strong>Chapter 25 Analysis</strong>
This chapter offers a devastating reminder of how easily society absorbs injustice. The metaphor of the roly-poly insect and Underwood’s editorial reinforce the moral universe of the novel — Tom Robinson, like the mockingbird, is utterly innocent but destroyed by forces stronger than himself. The brief public attention and rapid forgetting reflect a systemic indifference to Black suffering. Ewell's sinister statement foreshadows future danger, showing that hate, once emboldened, does not easily dissipate.

<strong>Chapter 26</strong>
As school resumes, Scout passes Boo Radley’s house daily. Her fascination with Boo matures; she now desires not to provoke him but simply to acknowledge his presence as a neighbor.

In class, Scout’s teacher Miss Gates rails against Hitler’s persecution of the Jews, celebrating America’s supposed equality. Yet Scout recalls hearing Miss Gates express racist remarks after the Tom Robinson trial, exposing the hypocrisy embedded in Maycomb’s moral self-image.

When Scout brings this up with Jem, he explodes in anger, refusing to discuss the trial. His reaction signals how deeply the injustice has affected him.

<strong>Chapter 26 Analysis</strong>
This chapter confronts one of the novel’s sharpest moral ironies: Maycomb condemns injustice abroad while practicing it at home. Miss Gates’ blindness illustrates how deeply racism is woven into social norms, even among those who see themselves as morally upright. Scout’s struggle to reconcile this hypocrisy signals her growing moral consciousness. Jem’s emotional breakdown reveals that while children may weep for injustice, even they eventually become overwhelmed by its complexity and cruelty.

<strong>Chapter 27</strong>
As autumn arrives, tensions in Maycomb simmer. Bob Ewell, having lost his job, begins targeting others connected to the trial. He stalks Judge Taylor and harasses Helen Robinson, until Link Deas intervenes to protect her.

The town organizes a Halloween pageant. Scout, dressed as a ham, performs her role while Jem watches. Afterwards, the siblings walk home together through the dark woods—an ominous setting for the climactic confrontation to come.

Scout notes with haunting foreshadowing that this night would mark “the longest journey together” she and Jem would ever take.

<strong>Chapter 27 Analysis</strong>
This chapter lays the groundwork for the novel’s final act, as Bob Ewell’s festering resentment moves from verbal threats to physical menace. His harassment of Helen underscores his cowardice — targeting the vulnerable when he can no longer attack Atticus directly. The Halloween setting reinforces the theme of distorted appearances: beneath the surface of community festivities lurks unresolved hatred. The looming danger reflects the novel’s warning that unpunished injustice breeds further violence.

<strong>Chapter 28</strong>
Walking home after the Halloween pageant, Scout and Jem sense they’re being followed. At first, they attribute their anxiety to Halloween pranks, but the tension quickly turns deadly when Bob Ewell ambushes them. In her clumsy ham costume, Scout struggles to see or move, while Jem tries to protect her.

During the attack, Scout hears the sounds of a violent struggle, followed by silence. Disoriented, she finally sees an unknown man carrying Jem home. Sheriff Tate later reveals that Bob Ewell is dead, his body found with a knife in his ribs.

<strong>Chapter 28 Analysis</strong>
The attack represents the explosive culmination of the town’s buried racial tensions and Bob Ewell’s personal vendetta. Scout’s costume becomes a powerful symbol of her childhood vulnerability — she is literally trapped inside it, blinded and helpless. Yet even in her innocence, she recognizes that evil has once again visited her family. The introduction of the mysterious rescuer — Boo Radley — begins the novel’s final moral turn, as Scout’s childhood fears are transformed into gratitude and empathy. Violence here emerges not just as physical harm but as the ultimate consequence of hatred left unchecked.
