        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 1</strong><br>a) Bacteria can develop resistance mechanisms when exposed to the same antibiotics over an extended period. Gradually, these antibiotics lose their effectiveness as bacteria adapt, eventually rendering the drugs powerless against infections.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 2</strong><br>During prolonged antibiotic treatment, bacteria reproduce and evolve into new strains that can survive the effects of the drugs. This evolutionary change is driven by the bacteria’s instinct to persist within a hospitable environment — the patient’s body — ensuring their survival and continued reproduction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 3</strong><br>These resistant bacterial strains can then spread within communities such as hospitals, exposing a wider patient population to these difficult-to-treat infections. To combat this, it is crucial to select the appropriate antibiotic based on identifying the exact bacterial species infecting the patient, thereby minimizing resistance development. Indiscriminate and prolonged use of antibiotics fosters the emergence and spread of resistant strains.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 4</strong><br>b) Scientists have expressed concern over the emergence of highly antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Initially, it was believed these strains were mainly confined to regions like Latin America, Asia, and Europe, with minimal presence in the United States.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 5</strong><br>However, research spanning 2000 to 2006 revealed that such resistant bacteria also exist in U.S. hospitals. Many of these strains, resistant to efforts to suppress them, have originated within hospital environments. This was a relatively unknown issue until these comprehensive studies highlighted its significance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 6</strong><br>c) New antibiotics may offer an advantage because bacteria have not yet encountered them and therefore have not developed resistance. These drugs target bacterial populations that are “naïve” to their action, making them effective in eliminating infections.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 7</strong><br>Consequently, these new drugs are more effective against bacteria thriving in suitable environments like the patient’s body. It is essential to limit the duration of treatment with new antibiotics to what is strictly necessary, minimizing the chance for bacteria to develop resistance to these drugs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 8</strong><br>d) One practical solution is to ensure antibiotics are prescribed specifically for the bacterial infection being treated, and patients adhere strictly to the prescribed duration. For example, if a 14-day course is recommended, completing the full course is vital to completely eradicate the bacteria and prevent the survival and evolution of resistant strains.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 9</strong><br>Reducing unnecessary antibiotic use also slows the development of bacterial resistance. By avoiding antibiotics when they are not needed, the risk of producing more resistant or entirely resistant bacterial strains decreases.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 10</strong><br>Lastly, antibiotics should only be administered when absolutely necessary, targeting the specific bacteria causing the infection, to avoid the negative consequences of resistance and to preserve antibiotic effectiveness.</p>
