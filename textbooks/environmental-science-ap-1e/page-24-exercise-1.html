        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 1</strong><br>a) The algae that appeared in the pond are the result of fertilizer use. Although the neighbor only applied fertilizer to their lawn—not directly to the pond—the nutrients eventually reached the pond due to water runoff. This often happens when it rains, especially if the soil has already absorbed too much fertilizer or if the yard is sloped.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 2</strong><br>Because the fertilized lawn was located on a slope, the incline allowed rainwater to carry the fertilizer downhill over time. This slow movement caused the nutrients to enter the pond at the base of the lawn.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 3</strong><br>Once the fertilizer, which contains essential nutrients, reached the pond, algae began to grow rapidly. Algae require only a small amount of sunlight and key nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus—both common in fertilizers—to thrive.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 4</strong><br>As a result, the fertilizer runoff triggered excessive algae growth, which can seriously harm the pond’s ecosystem. Large amounts of algae block sunlight from reaching the water below and take up space that other organisms rely on. This can reduce oxygen levels in the pond, putting fish and other aquatic animals at risk.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 5</strong><br>Image reference placeholder.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 6</strong><br>b) The image above (not shown here) likely illustrates a lawn on a slope leading directly to a pond. This helps demonstrate how the fertilizer moved downhill and caused algae to appear in the water. The experiment visualizes how the angle of the land made algae growth possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 7</strong><br>Due to the slope, rain or erosion washed the fertilizer from the lawn down into the pond. Once there, the excess nutrients promoted algae growth, especially at the bottom of the pond where the buildup was greatest.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 8</strong><br>In contrast, the second image (also not shown) likely shows a lawn and pond on the same level—no slope. In this scenario, the fertilizer would mostly stay near the lawn or sink slightly below the surface but would not travel far enough to reach the pond.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 9</strong><br>That’s because on flat ground, gravity doesn’t pull the fertilizer downward with much force. The steeper the slope, the stronger gravity’s influence—making sloped yards more likely to cause runoff than flat ones.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 10</strong><br>Image reference placeholder.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 11</strong><br>c) One way the neighbor could help restore the pond is by pausing all fertilizer use—especially near the slope. This gives the soil time to recover and prevents additional runoff from reaching the pond. Only fertilizing areas on flat ground (where runoff is less likely) would be a safer choice.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 12</strong><br>If no more fertilizer is applied, the algae in the pond will gradually run out of nutrients. As their food supply disappears, the algae will begin to die off, allowing the pond to slowly return to a healthier state.</p>
