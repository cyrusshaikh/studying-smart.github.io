        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>Step 1</strong><br>(I) The age distribution for Country B shows a heavily skewed structure, with the largest population groups concentrated in the youngest age ranges, especially among infants and children aged 5 to 10. In contrast, the upper sections of the diagram—representing older age groups—are very narrow. This indicates that Country B has a much younger population overall, especially when compared to Country A, where middle-aged individuals dominate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>Step 2</strong><br>(II) The diagram also reveals that Country B has a higher birth rate than Country A, as shown by the significantly larger number of individuals in the 0–1 age group. This suggests that more children are born annually in Country B. Since this group is large, it implies that infant mortality, while present, is not eliminating a majority of births—though the survival rate alone does not indicate low mortality without comparing outcomes over the next few age brackets.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>Step 3</strong><br>The 0–5 age group is key when evaluating infant and child mortality. Although Country B has more newborns than Country A, a sharp decline in the population through the early childhood years would reflect a higher infant and child mortality rate. If the population numbers significantly decrease in these early age ranges, it suggests that infant mortality is actually higher in Country B, not lower—despite the initial higher birth count.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>Step 4</strong><br>(III) In contrast, Country A exhibits slow or stagnant population growth. This is due to both low birth rates and low death rates, with the birth rate just barely exceeding the level needed for population replacement. As a result, the total number of people increases only gradually, if at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>Step 5</strong><br>Country B, on the other hand, shows potential for rapid population growth. Its younger population base includes a large number of individuals who are not yet of reproductive age, but who will soon enter that stage. With a wide base of youth, and assuming not all are lost to early mortality, the potential for future births is high. In comparison, Country A has fewer individuals in younger age groups, which limits its reproductive momentum.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>Step 6</strong><br>Given the shape of the age pyramid in Country B, the growth trend is likely to continue into the future. The large number of individuals currently in the pre-reproductive and early reproductive age ranges suggests that, unless birth rates drop significantly or external factors intervene, the population will keep expanding at a fast pace.</p>
