        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 1</strong><br>a) One major consequence of overusing environmental resources is the rise in global soil temperatures and increased air pollution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 2</strong><br>This happens primarily due to large-scale deforestation—trees are often cleared for agriculture or industrial development. Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in their biomass. When forests are removed, that natural carbon storage is lost, leading to an increase in CO₂ levels in the air.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 3</strong><br>This buildup of greenhouse gases causes a problem. When sunlight reaches Earth and heats the surface, that heat is normally reflected back into space. But when the air is polluted and filled with CO₂ and other particles, some of that heat gets trapped. Instead of escaping, it bounces off the pollution and is redirected back to Earth’s surface.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 4</strong><br>This cycle repeats several times, though with decreasing intensity. Still, each round of trapped heat adds to the warming effect on the planet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 5</strong><br>This phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect, and it contributes to rising global temperatures. In fact, the Earth’s average annual temperature has already increased by several degrees Celsius over recent decades.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 6</strong><br>b) A sustainable strategy for using environmental resources means ensuring that current use does not prevent future generations from accessing those same resources. This means any resource taken from nature should be replenished or restored at the same rate it is being used.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 7</strong><br>Sustainability requires that resource use stays below the threshold of maximum sustainable yield. For example, forests should only be partially harvested in a controlled way—and only as needed. New trees should be planted alongside harvested areas, allowing forests to regenerate and continue providing their benefits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 8</strong><br>To protect these natural systems, uncontrolled deforestation must be avoided. When forests are cut down faster than they can recover, they reach a tipping point where natural regeneration is no longer possible. Planting trees in sparsely wooded areas can help restore forest density and provide long-term ecological benefits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 9</strong><br>c) The collapse of the Easter Island civilization is a powerful example of what can happen when natural resources are used irresponsibly. The people who lived on the island consumed resources—like trees and soil nutrients—at a rapid rate, without a long-term plan for renewal or conservation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 10</strong><br>Each person used shared resources according to their own needs, without limits. As the population grew, resource demand grew as well, but the supply could not keep up. Eventually, the environment was depleted to the point where it could no longer recover on its own.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 11</strong><br>With fewer resources available per person, their way of life became unsustainable. As the ecosystem collapsed, many people were forced to leave the island, and some died from starvation and scarcity—leading to a sharp population decline.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 12</strong><br>This event is often cited as a classic example of the “tragedy of the commons”—when shared resources are overused and mismanaged. Warning signs began to appear once the natural systems could no longer renew themselves.</p>
