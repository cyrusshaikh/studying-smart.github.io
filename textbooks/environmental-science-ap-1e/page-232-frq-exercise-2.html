        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 1</strong><br>a) Traditional land use—such as growing crops like corn and wheat repeatedly—leads to rapid soil degradation. Over time, this reduces organic material, weakens soil structure, and increases the risk of landslides. Additionally, nitrates from fertilizers seep into groundwater and eventually flow into rivers and streams.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 2</strong><br>This kind of erosion happens at a high rate. Because the topsoil is stripped of nutrients, continued use of the land in this way is not sustainable. The fertile layer becomes too thin to support healthy plant growth, and the land’s ability to regenerate naturally diminishes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 3</strong><br>By comparison, fields that are periodically used as pastures show much healthier soil conditions. These systems regenerate the land, reduce erosion, and create a stable, self-sustaining cycle. They also improve biodiversity—birds, wild animals, and pollinating insects are more likely to thrive in pasture environments.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 4</strong><br>The benefits are measurable: nitrate pollution in groundwater is significantly reduced, soil stability improves by over 50%, and organic matter increases. Erosion is drastically lessened—grasslands experience up to 93% less erosion than cropland. In contrast, row crops can degrade soil up to 13 times faster than it forms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 5</strong><br>(I) Earthworms play a major role in improving soil structure. As they burrow, they create channels that help water penetrate the soil more deeply. This reduces surface runoff, increases water absorption, and helps anchor the soil, all of which limit erosion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 6</strong><br>(II) Organic matter, such as animal waste from cows and sheep grazing on pastures, enriches the soil with carbon. This carbon helps absorb nitrates, preventing them from polluting groundwater. Manure naturally boosts soil fertility, providing nutrients essential for plant growth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 7</strong><br>(III) One reason groundwater in pasture systems contains fewer nitrates is that synthetic fertilizers—which are rich in nitrates—are used far less. Because less fertilizer is applied, fewer nitrates seep into deep soil layers and underground water systems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 8</strong><br>Another factor is that pasture soils tend to be less porous, which limits the downward movement of water and dissolved nitrates. The soil’s structure helps trap nitrates near the surface, instead of letting them reach groundwater.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 9</strong><br>(IV) To improve the quality of groundwater, efforts should focus on reducing nitrate runoff—either by limiting fertilizer use or converting croplands into pasture. Healthier pastures help filter water naturally and prevent chemical pollution of underground aquifers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 10</strong><br>b) However, overgrazing can be harmful. When animals graze the same area continuously without proper rotation, they deplete all vegetation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 11</strong><br>If plants don’t have time to recover, the land becomes bare and damaged. Once the plant mass is exhausted, the pasture can't sustain the same number of animals, and soil quality quickly declines.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 12</strong><br>Overgrazing also disrupts biodiversity. Certain plant species that animals prefer get eaten more quickly, while less-palatable species are left to dominate, reducing plant variety across the landscape.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 13</strong><br>c) When grazing is not carefully managed, vegetation is stripped away, exposing bare soil to the elements. Without plant roots to hold the soil in place, riverbanks become vulnerable to erosion and floodwaters can easily wash them away.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 14</strong><br>If a river floods, this bare, compacted soil absorbs water much more slowly. Flooding spreads further and lasts longer because there are no plants to hold back or absorb the excess water.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 15</strong><br>Soil without vegetation becomes denser and less porous. Unlike loose, plant-covered soil that contains air pockets for water absorption, compacted ground allows water to sit on the surface and flow away, increasing the risk of erosion and flooding.</p>
