        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 1</strong><br>A key smart growth strategy that could be implemented by nearby landowners is mixed land use. This approach allows residential, recreational, educational, and commercial spaces to coexist within the same area. As a result, residents wouldn’t need to leave their community to access essential services, helping to create a more self-sufficient and connected neighborhood.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 2</strong><br>This layout would promote walking and cycling as practical means of transportation. With destinations nearby, the reliance on personal vehicles would decrease, which in turn would help reduce emissions and protect the surrounding environment—including the adjacent public lands.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 3</strong><br>Another smart growth principle involves cultivating a strong community identity and sense of place. When individuals feel a connection to their community, they are more likely to care for it, which has long-term benefits for both public and private spaces.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 4</strong><br>Residents who take pride in their surroundings are more likely to engage in environmentally responsible behavior. Their awareness of nature’s value can lead to reduced pollution, better land stewardship, and a greater appreciation for the green spaces where they live and spend time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 5</strong><br>A third principle centers on expanding transportation options. People in the surrounding area could reduce their environmental footprint by organizing shared transportation networks, carpooling systems, or even using community-owned vehicles. These systems would make it easier to meet mobility needs without increasing the number of cars on the road.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 6</strong><br>Ultimately, the goal is to limit the total number of private vehicles and thereby lower air pollution. Cleaner air would benefit not only nearby neighborhoods but also the protected ecosystems on public lands, including forests, lakes, and meadows. Reduced vehicle use would help preserve the health and integrity of these shared natural spaces.</p>
