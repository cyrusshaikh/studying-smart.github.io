        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 1</strong><br>In the past, people disposed of their trash in open dumps, which led to serious environmental and health problems. These sites attracted rodents, contaminated water sources, and contributed to air pollution. While many developed countries have phased out this practice, open dumping remains common in poorer nations, where it still poses a major public health threat.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 2</strong><br>As public concern grew during the 1930s, open dumping faced increasing backlash. To manage the growing volume of waste, communities began using excavated pits, often leftover from mining or construction, as dumping grounds for municipal solid waste (MSW).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 3</strong><br>These pits became what we now call landfills. Early landfill practices lacked proper oversight and failed to account for chemical runoff. Over time, it became clear that toxic substances in the waste could produce leachate—a hazardous liquid that seeps through the waste layers and can contaminate soil and groundwater.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 4</strong><br>To address these concerns, modern sanitary landfills were developed. These are specially engineered facilities designed to safely contain waste and minimize environmental impact.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 5</strong><br>Modern sanitary landfills use several systems to reduce pollution:<br><br>
          • A clay or plastic liner is placed at the bottom to prevent contaminants from seeping into the soil or water supply.<br>
          • A leachate collection system under the landfill gathers runoff, which is sometimes treated or returned to the waste pile.<br>
          • Once full, the landfill is sealed with a cap made of soil and clay to prevent water infiltration and limit gas emissions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 6</strong><br>The primary benefit of landfills is their ability to isolate hazardous materials from human populations. While they are an improvement over open dumps, they still pose environmental risks, particularly if leachate leaks into surrounding ecosystems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 7</strong><br>Because most MSW contains a large proportion of carbon-based materials like paper and food scraps, it has significant potential as a fuel source. This makes it suitable for incineration, a waste management method that involves burning trash to reduce its mass and sometimes produce energy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 8</strong><br>During incineration, trash is loaded into a furnace where it burns at high temperatures. The main byproducts are carbon dioxide, water vapor, heat, and solid residues known as ash or particulate matter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 9</strong><br>In a waste-to-energy system, the heat generated from incineration isn’t wasted—it’s used to produce steam, which powers turbines and generates electricity. Any leftover ash is usually disposed of in a landfill, and emissions are filtered to reduce pollution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>STEP 10</strong><br>In summary, incinerating waste offers the dual advantage of reducing landfill volume and generating power. However, these facilities are expensive to build and operate, and they require a consistent, large volume of waste to remain efficient.</p>
