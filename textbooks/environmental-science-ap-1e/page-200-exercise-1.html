          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>In what’s known as the first phase of demographic transition, population growth is extremely slow. This is because both birth rates and death rates remain high, with only slight fluctuations over time. As the phase nears its end, the death rate begins to gradually decrease, but the growth in population is still minimal. During this early phase, societies are primarily agricultural, with limited medical knowledge, high infant mortality, and low life expectancy. Families tend to have many children—partly due to cultural norms, and partly because extra hands are needed for hard physical labor in farming and livestock. Poor healthcare, malnutrition, and harsh working conditions also contribute to high death rates. Children are also seen as a future source of support for aging parents, which encourages large families.</p>

        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>In the second phase, population growth begins to accelerate significantly. This happens because death rates drop sharply due to improvements in sanitation, healthcare, food supply, and general living conditions. However, birth rates stay high, so the difference between births and deaths causes a rapid increase in population size. Even though governments may begin promoting family planning and population control measures, the effects take time to appear. Many families still have several children, unaware that infant survival has improved. This delay in behavioral change results in what's known as population momentum—the population continues to grow for a generation or more, even as fertility rates begin to decline.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>The third phase of demographic transition is marked by a slowing of population growth. The birth rate steadily decreases, while the death rate has already stabilized at a low level. This causes population growth to flatten out and eventually peak. Several factors contribute to this shift: urbanization, increased income, higher education levels, and changing social norms. Families begin to have fewer children, often because jobs require more education and are increasingly based in industry or skilled labor. With greater economic opportunity and improved living conditions, people prioritize quality of life and invest more in fewer children. In some developing countries, however, traditional, religious, or cultural influences may slow down the decline in birth rates during this phase.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>Step 4:</strong><br>The fourth and final phase is defined by stable or even declining population growth. Both birth and death rates are low and remain relatively constant. Population size tends to plateau, with only small fluctuations over time. In highly developed nations at this stage, the economy is strong, healthcare is advanced, and most people enjoy high standards of living. However, a key feature of this phase is an aging population, where the proportion of elderly individuals exceeds that of younger, working-age people. This can lead to labor shortages and increased pressure on social support systems. Some of these effects are mitigated by immigration, which brings in younger workers. In wealthier families, it’s also more common for parents to choose to have additional children because they have the means to support them comfortably.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>Step 5:</strong><br>To reduce birth and death rates, especially in developing countries, governments can adopt strategies that promote family planning and smaller households. Public education campaigns—supported by media, healthcare providers, schools, and community leaders—can help shift attitudes toward smaller family sizes. Emphasizing the benefits of having fewer children, such as better healthcare, increased family income, and more educational opportunities, can help drive long-term demographic change.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-box">
          <p class="text-base leading-relaxed"><strong>Step 6:</strong><br>Such strategies are more effective when accompanied by economic development. Low-income countries may face challenges due to limited infrastructure or low GDP, which can make implementation harder. However, in practice, progress can still be made even under difficult conditions. For example, Nicaragua successfully lowered both fertility and mortality rates through focused policies—even while facing poverty—bringing its population structure closer to that seen in the fourth phase of demographic transition.</p>
