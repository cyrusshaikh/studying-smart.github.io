        <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Step 1</h2>
        <p>Over time, human influence on the environment has grown significantly, largely due to the development of tools and technological advancements that enhanced hunting capabilities.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Step 2</h2>
        <p>In early human history, people had very little impact on the environment. Without advanced tools or weapons, they lacked the means to significantly alter ecosystems or threaten wildlife populations.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Step 3</h2>
        <p>As technology began to progress, humans started creating and utilizing increasingly effective tools. These tools—though primitive at first—gradually became more sophisticated. With broader access to these innovations, humans began using them in greater numbers, which led to a more noticeable environmental footprint.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Step 4</h2>
        <p>Early technologies gave rise to basic hunting tools that allowed people to capture animals. Initially, these tools were simple, and their effect on animal populations was limited. But as technology improved, more advanced weapons were developed, leading to a sharp rise in hunting activity and efficiency.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Step 5</h2>
        <p>As hunting methods became more effective, some animal species were hunted to the point of extinction—especially large mammals that were once abundant. This marks a major turning point where human activity began having serious long-term consequences on the environment.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Result</h2>
        <p>In summary, technological progress dramatically expanded human ability to alter the environment, particularly through hunting, which eventually contributed to species loss and ecological imbalance.</p>
