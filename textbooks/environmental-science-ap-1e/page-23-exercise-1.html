        <p>Human impact on the environment has grown alongside the development of tools and technological progress, especially through advancements that enhanced hunting practices.</p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Step 2</h2>
        <p>In early times, humans had a minimal effect on the environment. Without tools or weapons, they had no real way to significantly disrupt ecosystems or wildlife.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Step 3</h2>
        <p>As human innovation advanced, people began crafting and using various tools. These tools, though basic at first, steadily evolved and became more refined. Over time, widespread use of such technology allowed humans to interact with and affect the environment much more significantly.</p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Step 4</h2>
        <p>Early technologies enabled people to create simple weapons for hunting. Initially, these tools had a limited impact. But as societies developed and tools became more advanced, hunting grew more efficient, increasing the pressure on animal populations.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Step 5</h2>
        <p>Eventually, human hunting practices led to the extinction of some large animal species. This increase in hunting power marked a major shift in humanity’s environmental influence.</p>
