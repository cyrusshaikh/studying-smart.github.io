    <!-- Step-by-Step Solution -->
    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-md space-y-6">
      <div>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong>  
        Rocks are classified into three main types based on their formation: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.
      </div>

      <div>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong>  
        Igneous rocks are the oldest on Earth and make up the core structure of the continents. They form from the cooling of molten magma and are categorized as either intrusive or extrusive, depending on where the cooling occurs.
      </div>

      <div>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong>  
        Intrusive igneous rocks form when magma cools and solidifies deep inside the Earth’s crust.<br>
        Extrusive igneous rocks form when lava erupts and cools on the surface.<br>
        <em>Example of intrusive:</em> Granite<br>
        <em>Example of extrusive:</em> Basalt
      </div>

      <div>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong>  
        Granite solidifies slowly beneath Earth’s surface, allowing larger crystals to form.<br>
        Basalt, formed by rapid lava cooling on the surface, usually has much smaller crystals.
      </div>

      <div>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong>  
        Sedimentary rocks develop through the deposition and accumulation of materials like sand, silt, gravel, or organic matter. These materials are often transported and laid down by wind, water, or ice. Sedimentary rocks are subdivided into clastic, chemical, and organic types.
      </div>

      <div>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong>  
        Sandstone is a common clastic sedimentary rock, formed from compacted and cemented sand particles. It’s primarily composed of minerals such as quartz, muscovite, and feldspar, and comes in various colors (e.g., brown, yellow, pink, white).
      </div>

      <div>
        <strong>Step 7:</strong>  
        Metamorphic rocks originate from pre-existing igneous or sedimentary rocks that undergo physical and chemical changes due to high temperature and pressure—a process known as metamorphism.
      </div>

      <div>
        <strong>Step 8:</strong>  
        When existing rocks are exposed to new environmental conditions, they undergo structural and mineralogical changes to form metamorphic rocks. Common examples include marble, gneiss, schist, and slate.
      </div>

      <div>
        <strong>Step 9:</strong>  
        Marble is a well-known metamorphic rock, formed when limestone or dolomite undergoes metamorphism. It is dense and durable, making it ideal for use in sculpture and architecture.
