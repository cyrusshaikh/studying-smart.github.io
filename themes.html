    <h2>📚 Themes in <em>Poor Things</em></h2>

    <h3>Gender, Power, and the Myth of Female Dependence</h3>
    <p>At the heart of <em>Poor Things</em> lies a searing critique of how Victorian society conceptualized womanhood—particularly the sharp divide, and eerie similarities, between the roles expected of upper-class and lower-class women. Upper-class women like Victoria were groomed to be docile and dependent, trained to serve as trophies in patriarchal households. Their worth hinged on sexual purity before marriage and unquestioned availability after it. Lower-class women, while not expected to embody virtue, were exploited for their sexual availability, with little recourse if they became pregnant or abused.</p>
    <p>Gray’s novel illustrates how these roles, though socially distinct, ultimately serve the same patriarchal logic: women are to be owned, sexualized, and silenced, regardless of class. Victoria herself identifies this pattern when she reflects on how her father, her husband Blessington, and even McCandless attempted to contain her life within narratives that served their own authority.</p>
    <p>McCandless’s fantastical story of Bella Baxter—a woman with the mind of a child and the body of a sexually mature adult—reveals the unconscious desires of Victorian masculinity. He eroticizes infantilization, imagining a wife who is curious, pliant, and malleable. His depiction of Godwin further blurs boundaries between father, creator, and potential husband, echoing the legal and cultural transfer of ownership from father to husband embedded in Victorian marriage practices.</p>
    <p>By contrast, Victoria’s self-written letter reclaims her life. She presents her marriage as a practical arrangement, not a romantic triumph, and situates her autonomy in education, medical knowledge, and solidarity with other women. Her vision of womanhood is not passive but productive, grounded in care, action, and self-definition. Gray’s critique—delivered through conflicting narratives and feminist irony—ultimately exposes how women’s voices are marginalized not just socially, but textually.</p>

    <h3>Medicine, Class, and the Politics of Bodily Autonomy</h3>
    <p><em>Poor Things</em> is not merely a historical novel—it is a profoundly political one, deeply concerned with the intersection of science, class, and social justice. The Victorian period saw dramatic advances in medicine: germ theory, anesthesia, contraception, and sanitation all emerged or expanded during this era. But as Gray’s novel shows, the benefits of these discoveries were often limited by who had access to them—and who was allowed to control them.</p>
    <p>Through characters like Godwin Baxter and Victoria, Gray presents medicine not as an apolitical science, but as a battleground. Godwin champions public health for the poor, arguing that the best medicine is clean air, safe housing, and decent wages. Victoria continues his mission through the Godwin Baxter Natal Clinic, advocating for reproductive autonomy and challenging the dominance of male obstetricians. Her writings—on childbirth, contraception, and children’s health—reflect a belief that medicine should not reinforce patriarchy, but liberate people from it.</p>
    <p>Other characters resist this vision. Dr. Hooker and Mr. Astley, in particular, reflect imperialist and eugenic ideologies. Hooker believes colonialism is a moral mission, while Astley insists that suffering is natural and even necessary. For them, medical and political progress are not compatible. Bella, however, rejects both views and embraces socialism, identifying medicine as a tool for collective liberation.</p>
    <p>Gray explores how medical knowledge, like narrative power, is a means of control. Bella/Victoria’s desire to educate others—especially poor women—makes her a political threat. Critics, fictional and fictionalized, attack her not with reason but with ridicule, accusing her of perversion and lunacy. These attacks parallel real-world responses to early feminist and socialist reformers, underscoring how Gray uses historical fiction to illuminate modern debates about healthcare, class, and reproductive rights.</p>

    <h3>Who Gets to Tell the Story? Narrative, Authority, and Interpretation</h3>
    <p><em>Poor Things</em> is a masterclass in postmodern storytelling—deliberately structured to call attention to how stories are shaped, filtered, and contested. Rather than a linear, omniscient narrative, Gray gives us a tangle of perspectives: McCandless’s manuscript, Bella/Victoria’s letter, Gray’s footnotes, and even off-page figures like Michael Donnelly. The result is a novel that refuses to offer a single, stable truth.</p>
    <p>This layered structure emphasizes the politics of narrative control. Each narrator has an agenda. McCandless writes to glorify himself and romanticize his relationship with Bella. Gray, in his editorial role, chooses to believe McCandless over Victoria, even as her version is more plausible and internally consistent. Donnelly, the skeptical historian, never gets to speak directly, but his doubt casts a long shadow over the entire text.</p>
    <p>Victoria’s letter attempts to break this cycle. She writes not as a mythologizer, but as a woman correcting the record—clarifying that she was not created by Godwin, was never amnesiac, and was never a child in a woman’s body. Her tone is candid, unapologetic, and politically charged. Yet even this document is subject to editorial interference: Gray’s footnotes sometimes subtly undermine her claims, reminding us that no account is ever free from manipulation.</p>
    <p>In true postmodern fashion, Gray does not resolve these contradictions. Instead, he challenges readers to wade through conflicting evidence and question who benefits from each version of the story. What does it mean to create a woman in fiction? What is erased in the process? These questions are not just literary—they’re political, gendered, and urgent.</p>

    <h3>Science Fiction, Gothic Horror, and Feminist Satire</h3>
    <p>While <em>Poor Things</em> is grounded in the realist tradition of 19th-century fiction, it is also a playful homage to—and critique of—science fiction and Gothic literature. The premise of Bella’s resurrection evokes <em>Frankenstein</em>, while the narrative’s unreliable voices recall the structure of <em>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em>. But unlike Shelley or Stevenson, Gray uses these tropes not to explore the monstrous other, but to satirize the men who create monsters in order to feel like gods.</p>
    <p>McCandless’s tale is a pastiche of Gothic absurdity: resurrections, amnesia, medical laboratories, and philosophical debates abound. But the horror does not lie in Bella herself—it lies in how she is interpreted, handled, and narrated by men. Gray parodies the Gothic genre to expose how it often reduces women to symbols or creatures rather than full human beings.</p>
    <p>Victoria’s letter functions as the corrective voice. She dismantles the genre altogether, replacing mystery and melodrama with concrete socio-political history. Her story is about poverty, misogyny, and systemic injustice—not reanimation. In doing so, Gray collapses the boundary between genre and critique, using the very tools of fiction to reclaim the woman lost in fiction.</p>

    <h3>Memory, Myth, and Historical Reconstruction</h3>
    <p>Beyond gender and politics, <em>Poor Things</em> also meditates on how history is recorded—and by whom. Memory in the novel is not stable; it is contested. Bella’s supposed amnesia is revealed to be a myth. McCandless rewrites the past to cope with insecurity. Gray claims neutrality, but curates his edition with obvious bias. Even Victoria, in her clarifying letter, admits she cannot account for everything—some silences remain.</p>
    <p>This theme speaks directly to the construction of historical narratives more broadly. How many women like Victoria had their voices drowned out by lovers, husbands, or editors? How many radicals were reduced to caricature by the very people who claimed to champion them? Gray suggests that recovering these voices is not just about memory—it’s about justice.</p>
    <p><em>Poor Things</em> reminds us that every narrative is a battleground, shaped by power, ideology, and the limits of the storyteller. The text refuses to give readers the comfort of knowing “what really happened.” Instead, it insists that ambiguity is the point—and that truth must be assembled, not received.</p>
