    <h2>üìñ Victoria McCandless‚Äôs Letter</h2>

    <p>The final narrative voice in Poor Things belongs to Victoria McCandless, formerly known as Bella Baxter. Her letter, written in 1945 and intended for her eldest living descendant in 1974, serves as a direct response to Archibald McCandless‚Äôs manuscript. Victoria assumes her sons will be dead or senile by the time the letter is read and hopes to correct the many distortions in her husband‚Äôs published account, which, she reveals, cost him a great deal to print and promote.
Victoria begins by stating that her marriage to McCandless was one of practicality, not passion. Over time, she grew fond of him and appreciated his reliability, but their relationship was not romantic in the way he portrayed it. She is particularly dismissive of McCandless‚Äôs alleged career achievements: he served as a public health officer for only eleven months before becoming chairman of the Glasgow Civic Improvement Trust, a position that left him ample free time. This time, she explains, he spent raising their sons‚ÄîBaxter, Godwin, and Archibald‚Äîwhile she focused on her work as a physician.</p>

<p>Victoria describes McCandless as an insecure man obsessed with writing, whose books were largely self-published and poorly received. He frequently sought her approval, which she found tiresome, particularly as she viewed his literary ambitions as a missed opportunity to work for meaningful reform among the labor class, from which he had come. In 1908, McCandless diagnosed himself with disseminated sclerosis, retreated to his bed, and began writing a mysterious manuscript he refused to share with her. He instructed her to read it only after his death.
After McCandless died, Victoria read the manuscript and was dismayed by its inaccuracies and embellishments. She makes it immediately clear that she never experienced amnesia. Her memory, in fact, is vivid‚Äîespecially when it comes to the trauma of her childhood. Her father, though wealthy, was violent and selfish, spending his money on business rather than family. He once struck Victoria so severely that she was left with a scar around her skull, the same scar McCandless would later fictionalize as "mysteriously regular." Her brothers died of cholera, and she received no early education.</p>

<p>A dramatic shift in her social status came when her father moved the family to a townhouse and sent her to a convent school. There, she received a limited education designed only to make her into a marriageable woman. She married General Blessington not out of love but to escape her father‚Äôs abuse. Yet marriage brought no freedom‚Äîonly repression. After six months of marriage, Victoria was so sexually frustrated that she begged for a clitoridectomy and was referred to Dr. Godwin Baxter.</p>

<p>Contrary to McCandless‚Äôs grotesque portrayal, Victoria remembers Godwin not as a monster, but as a profoundly kind and sorrowful man who made her feel safe. Godwin refused to perform the procedure, telling her gently that her suffering was not a physical illness but the result of lifelong mistreatment by selfish and foolish men. He agreed to take her in if she fled from her husband, and two months later, when Blessington impregnated a young servant and Victoria fled, Godwin honored his word.</p>

<p>To protect her from scandal, Godwin invented the persona of Bella Baxter‚Äîclaiming she was the amnesiac daughter of a cousin who had died in South America. Godwin introduced Victoria to his mother, Mrs. Dinwiddie, and resumed her education, urging her not to reject her past but to build upon all her experiences. During this time, Victoria occasionally attended the theatre with Godwin‚Äôs lawyer friend, Duncan Wedderburn, and eventually met McCandless‚Äîan awkward man whose excessive salivation made a poor impression. She suspected immediately that McCandless was more enamored with his own fantasy of her than with her as a person.</p>

<p>As time passed, Victoria fell deeply in love with Godwin. He, however, refused to reciprocate in romantic terms, declaring that he wanted ‚Äúno master‚Äîand no mistress.‚Äù When she discovered that he was terminally ill from inherited syphilis, she resolved to become a doctor, either to cure him or to carry forward his legacy. Godwin approved and encouraged her to find a partner who would not interfere with her ambitions.</p>

<p>Eventually, she agreed to marry McCandless because he was emotionally submissive and would allow her to continue her work uninterrupted. After a kiss‚Äîonly her second after an affair with a female piano teacher‚ÄîMcCandless proposed. Victoria quickly accepted, though she still wondered if there might be more passionate men elsewhere. On a whim, she eloped with Duncan, unaware that he wished to marry her too. When he had a breakdown, she returned to find Godwin dying, with McCandless already living in the house. Godwin asked Victoria to care for his dogs and bequeathed everything to her. She helped him end his life painlessly with poison.</p>

<p>Victoria ends her letter by urging her descendant to evaluate both her own account and McCandless‚Äôs and decide which is more credible. She accuses McCandless of crafting a fantastical Gothic tale, filled with stolen motifs and repressed truths. He felt shame about his working-class roots, she claims, and projected that shame onto both her and Godwin, denying them childhoods and creating a universe where all three were socially and emotionally equal. Victoria also denies having ever been pregnant and asserts that the fictional child was part of McCandless‚Äôs effort to romanticize their relationship.
In closing, she emphasizes her commitment to socialism and expresses hope that the political struggles of her era have led to a better world for future generations.</p>

<h2>üîç Analysis & Interpretation</h2>
<h4>Analysis: Victoria‚Äôs Letter</h4>
<p>This letter not only functions as a narrative counterweight to McCandless‚Äôs manuscript‚Äîit destabilizes the entire structure of the novel. Where McCandless romanticized Bella as a miraculous creation, Victoria dismantles that myth, reasserting control over her identity and emphasizing realism over fantasy. The discrepancy between the two accounts becomes the novel‚Äôs final game with the reader: Who should be believed?
Victoria‚Äôs tone is pragmatic, unembellished, and grounded in socio-political awareness. Her recollection of trauma, abuse, and class mobility unravels McCandless‚Äôs storybook version of events. But more than correcting facts, her letter critiques the male narrative impulse‚Äîthe need to possess, retell, and reshape female lives in ways that affirm male dignity and ego. McCandless‚Äôs Bella was dependent, pliant, and mystified. Victoria, in contrast, is rational, angry, ambitious, and self-made.
Thematically, the letter reinforces Gray‚Äôs broader critique of Victorian patriarchy, scientific romanticism, and literary authority. Victoria‚Äôs letter is not simply a revision‚Äîit is a reclamation, an act of historiographic metafiction where the subject writes back to the authors who have claimed her.</p>

<h2>üìò Footnote #35</h2>
<p>In the final editorial footnote, Alasdair Gray‚Äîor perhaps his fictional editor‚Äîreframes Bella/Victoria‚Äôs life in the form of a historical capsule. The footnote confirms that she continued using the name Victoria McCandless after her marriage. In 1890, she formally became a doctor and opened the Godwin Baxter Natal Clinic, staffed entirely by women she trained herself. Her commitment to maternal healthcare was radical: she barely paused her work to give birth to her three sons, insisting that she should be held to the same standards as her working-class patients, who could not afford maternity leave.
Victoria‚Äôs activism extended into publishing. Her controversial pamphlet Against Horizontalism challenged traditional childbirth practices, urging women to give birth in a squat to reduce pain and complications. She criticized the paternalistic authority of male doctors and advocated for mass medical literacy, suggesting that schoolchildren should be taught basic nursing and health theory so they could agitate for better social conditions.
Her ideas attracted ridicule and hostility. Medical journals denounced her for ‚Äúdangerous socialism‚Äù and accused her of undermining professional medicine. Her most controversial work, A Loving Economy ‚Äì A Mother‚Äôs Recipe for the End of All National and Class Warfare, proposed radical ideas about parenting and sexual education. While the footnote does not quote the text directly, it includes hostile reviews that accuse her of incest advocacy and erotomania‚Äîallegations clearly rooted in sexist panic.</p>

<p>Victoria‚Äôs political life was further complicated by war. Despite her anti-war views, two of her sons died in combat during World War I. Her third son, who worked in government propaganda, was killed in 1919 by a car. She interpreted the war as a tragedy of emotional neglect and social conformity, calling it an ‚Äúepidemic of suicidal obedience.‚Äù She blamed the failures of parenting‚Äîespecially among the middle class‚Äîfor producing such blind allegiance to empire and violence.
Although Victoria faced legal trouble over alleged abortion practices, she was never convicted. She gradually withdrew from public life, continuing to serve poor patients and animals alike. In 1925, when asked by a journalist what advice she would give to young people, she handed over a copy of A Loving Economy.
The last documented evidence of her life is a letter she wrote to the poet Hugh MacDiarmid in 1945. In it, she remained hopeful about the future‚Äîanticipating the fall of empire, the rise of the welfare state, and universal healthcare. She referred to her book as a neglected masterpiece and made a final reference to her intimate knowledge of her own biology. She died on December 3, 1946, from a cerebral hemorrhage, just as she had predicted.</p>

<h2>üîç Analysis & Interpretation</h2>
<h4>Analysis: Footnote #35</h4>
<p>This final footnote provides Poor Things with its closing ironic twist‚Äîa seemingly ‚Äúobjective‚Äù historical summary that itself is laced with ambiguity, satire, and unresolved contradictions. Unlike McCandless‚Äôs fantasy or Victoria‚Äôs sober account, the footnote uses public records, press reactions, and institutional discourse to frame Bella/Victoria‚Äôs legacy. But even these are deeply compromised‚Äîtainted by misogyny, sensationalism, and class anxiety.
Victoria‚Äôs transformation from fictional character to real historical figure blurs the boundary between invented biography and historiography. Gray suggests that even after death, women‚Äôs lives are mediated not by what they did, but by what others were afraid they represented: sexual freedom, anti-authoritarian thought, maternal autonomy, and socialist futurism.
The critiques of her work‚Äîespecially A Loving Economy‚Äîreflect anxieties about unconventional family structures, radical pedagogy, and female agency. In a world that feared maternal intimacy, non-traditional childrearing, and sexual honesty, Victoria‚Äôs views were branded as obscene. This final act of historical marginalization mirrors the same systems that tried to control her body, erase her voice, and fictionalize her life.
Yet her optimism endures. The letter to MacDiarmid expresses faith in collective progress, social equality, and the fall of empire. That she predicts her death accurately is both poignant and uncanny‚Äîperhaps her final assertion of narrative control.</p>
