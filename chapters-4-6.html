    <h2 id="ch4-6">📖 Chapters 4–6 Summary</h2>
    <p>Following their heated disagreement, Archibald McCandless and Godwin Baxter go months without speaking. During this estrangement, McCandless experiences a growing sense of loneliness and emotional dislocation—until, by chance, he encounters Godwin on the street. To McCandless’s surprise, Godwin seems cheerful and revitalized. The reason, he says, is that he’s been spending time with a young woman—one whom he proudly claims to have "cured of death."</p>
    <p>McCandless, ever the rationalist, assumes that Godwin is using figurative language, that he must mean he saved her from dying. But Godwin corrects him with eerie calm: he didn’t save her life—he resurrected her.</p>
    <p>He invites McCandless to visit his home and meet this remarkable woman. Once there, McCandless is introduced to Bella Baxter, a strikingly beautiful but strangely childlike woman. Her speech and behavior are infantile. She is astonished, for instance, when McCandless gently kisses her hand—a gesture she reacts to with wide-eyed confusion and innocent delight. To McCandless, her mental state appears stunted, and he assumes she has brain damage.</p>
    <p>Godwin, however, takes McCandless aside and explains that Bella is not brain-damaged but rapidly developing. In fact, only six months earlier, she had “the brain of a baby.” Now, she is advancing daily in her speech, understanding, and social behavior. McCandless is so overwhelmed by this revelation that he nearly collapses. Godwin offers him a bizarre, organic elixir made from fruits and vegetables, which McCandless refuses. Instead, he accepts a more traditional comfort: a glass of port. And with that, Godwin begins to tell him the full story.</p>
    <h2>📖 Chapter 5 Summary: “Making Bella Baxter”</h2>
    <p>Godwin recounts an astonishing—and deeply unsettling—sequence of events. A year earlier, shortly after his falling-out with McCandless, he was called to examine the corpse of a young pregnant woman who had died by suicide. Her identity was unclear: she had removed her wedding ring, and no one came to claim the body.</p>
    <p>Most doctors would have signed a death certificate and moved on. But Godwin, driven by curiosity and his own experimental ambition, did something radical. He sustained her body at a “purely cellular level”—preventing decomposition without reawakening consciousness. He then implanted a new brain into her body and eventually succeeded in animating it. The result was Bella Baxter.</p>
    <p>To protect his secret, Godwin invented a backstory: Bella would be presented to society as his orphaned niece, recently returned from Argentina after the tragic death of her parents.</p>
    <p>Bella’s progress has been rapid but uneven. While she initially gravitated toward playing with infants, her intellectual capacity has since developed to what Godwin estimates is that of a four-year-old child. Still, certain traits from her adult body’s former life—especially physical and sensory instincts—seem to linger.</p>
    <p>This is where the story takes a darker turn.</p>
    <p>Godwin casually remarks that Bella experiences vague, bodily recollections of physical intimacy from her former life. McCandless is appalled by this comment, particularly given Bella’s current mental state. Drunk and furious, McCandless accuses Godwin of engineering a living fantasy—“a woman with the trusting and dependent mind of a child,” molded for male pleasure and domination. The accusation is sharp and unsettling. Godwin responds by locking McCandless in the room until he sobers up.</p>
    <h2>📖 Chapter 6 Summary: “Baxter’s Dream”</h2>
    <p>Once McCandless has calmed, Godwin opens up to him more vulnerably than ever before. He admits that throughout his life, he has yearned for companionship, but his grotesque appearance has always driven people away. Bella, however, does not judge him. She has never seen another adult man and therefore sees Godwin not as strange or hideous, but simply as kind.</p>
    <p>Godwin claims that he has no inappropriate intentions—at least not yet. For now, he is content being seen as a father figure, a protector, someone Bella trusts. But his attachment is undeniable, and the power imbalance in their relationship is impossible to ignore.</p>
    <p>McCandless, still shaken but fascinated, asks to see Bella again. Godwin refuses—at least for now. He plans to take Bella on a global voyage so she can learn more about the world and mature intellectually and emotionally. Only then, he implies, will she be truly ready to engage with others, including McCandless.</p>
    <p>As McCandless is escorted out, he asks one last question: What happened to the unborn baby carried by Bella’s original body?</p>
    <p>Godwin’s answer is chilling: he removed the fetus’s brain and placed it inside the woman’s skull. The mind growing inside Bella, he implies, is not that of the original woman—but her unborn child.</p>
    <h2>🔍 Analysis & Interpretation</h2>
    <h3>“Playing God” and the Ethics of Creation</h3>
    <p>In these chapters, Poor Things plunges fully into its Frankensteinian heart. Godwin Baxter does not merely practice medicine—he manipulates life itself. His resurrection of Bella crosses ethical lines that even the most experimental scientists in literature rarely dare to touch. Gray uses Godwin’s “achievement” to raise profound questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What constitutes a person?</li>
      <li>Is consciousness separable from the body?</li>
      <li>Do scientific goals justify ethical transgressions?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By placing a fetal brain into an adult woman’s body, Godwin doesn’t just revive someone—he manufactures a new being altogether. This inversion of birth and identity is disturbing, and it deliberately unsettles the reader’s sense of morality and science.</p>
    <h3>Power, Gender, and Fantasy</h3>
    <p>McCandless’s drunken outburst strikes at the core of the book’s feminist subtext. He accuses Godwin of constructing a woman to fulfill male fantasy: beautiful, physically adult, but mentally childlike—passive, pliant, and dependent. Whether or not Godwin intended this outcome, the dynamic he’s created is inherently exploitative.</p>
    <p>Gray forces readers to confront the uncomfortable intersection of male desire, patriarchal control, and scientific ambition. Bella exists in a body with a sexual history, yet has no conscious understanding of that history. She is an object of both innocence and adult physicality, and that contrast makes her deeply vulnerable.</p>
    <h3>Godwin’s Monstrous Humanity</h3>
    <p>Godwin Baxter is perhaps the most ethically ambiguous character in the novel. He is both monstrous and heartbreakingly human. His desire for companionship is understandable—even sympathetic—but it is inseparable from the horrific method he used to satisfy it.</p>
    <p>He speaks tenderly of Bella, yet holds complete control over her life, development, and identity. He provides shelter and education, but he also controls the narrative of who she is and how she will be seen by others. The power imbalance is undeniable.</p>
    <h3>Identity and Rebirth</h3>
    <p>By the end of Chapter 6, the central philosophical theme of Poor Things becomes clear: What makes us who we are? Is it our memories? Our bodies? Our relationships? Bella, as a being born from death, occupies a liminal space. Her identity is fragmented: her body belongs to one woman, her brain to another life entirely. And the people around her—especially Godwin and McCandless—each want her to be something that suits their own emotional or ideological needs.</p>
    <p>The novel invites us to consider how identity can be shaped, rewritten, and exploited—not just by science, but by love, grief, and longing.</p>
