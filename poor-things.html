      <p><em>Poor Things</em> by Alasdair Gray is a novel that immediately defies conventional storytelling. Rather than claiming authorship, Gray adopts the role of editor, curating and presenting a “discovered” manuscript written by a man named Archibald McCandless, a Scottish public health officer. This layered narrative technique—where fiction masquerades as historical record—serves as a gateway to the book’s deeper themes of truth, identity, and societal hypocrisy.</p>

      <p>According to Gray’s preface, the manuscript surfaced in the 1970s, found in the possession of one Dr. Victoria McCandless. The package containing the manuscript was addressed to her eldest surviving grandchild and included two critical items: (1) a document titled <em>Episodes from the Early Life of a Scottish Public Health Officer</em>, and (2) a personal letter written by Victoria herself. In the manuscript, Archibald McCandless recounts a shocking event from 1881, in which a brilliant but controversial surgeon allegedly “used human remains to create a twenty-five-year-old woman.” This woman, later revealed to be named Bella Baxter, is at the heart of the story’s mystery and ethical complexity.</p>

      <p>Victoria’s letter casts immediate doubt on the manuscript’s truthfulness, asserting that the entire narrative is fictional and that her husband’s account distorts reality. This conflicting testimony creates a narrative tension between McCandless’s passionate, even fantastical storytelling, and Victoria’s cold, rational rebuttal.</p>

      <p>In 1990, a fictional historian named Michael Donnelly—who uncovered the package—gives the manuscript to Alasdair Gray. Donnelly hopes that Gray will publish it as a work of fiction. Gray agrees, but only under the condition that he has full editorial freedom. He changes the chapter titles and names the compiled volume <em>Poor Things</em>. The letter from Victoria is published as an Epilogue.</p>

      <p>What follows is a metafictional battle over truth. Donnelly believes the manuscript is fabricated, while Gray contends that it is genuine and that Victoria's rebuttal is itself a calculated attempt to bury an uncomfortable truth. Gray supports his claim by assembling a timeline of verifiable historical events, starting with McCandless’s enrollment at Glasgow University in 1879 and ending with Victoria’s own medical education in 1886. However, Gray fails to provide conclusive documentation—missing official records, marriage certificates, and news clippings—leaving the reader in a haze of ambiguity.</p>

      <p>Further complicating matters is Gray’s admission that he lost the original manuscript. Donnelly is furious, but Gray remains unbothered. For Gray, the facts matter less than the story's emotional truth and its power to provoke thought.</p>

      <p>This introduction sets the tone for the novel’s central questions: What is real? Who gets to tell the story? And what happens when multiple versions of the past collide?</p>
