    <h2>üë§ Character Analysis</h2>

 <h3>Bella Baxter / Victoria McCandless</h3>
    <p>Bella Baxter and Victoria McCandless are two identities that belong to a single woman‚Äîone fictionalized by others, the other claimed by herself. In Archibald McCandless‚Äôs account, Bella is presented as a modern Frankenstein‚Äôs Creature: a woman with the brain of an infant, resurrected into the body of a grown woman. Her erratic syntax and hyper-accelerated mental development mirror Gothic tropes of unnatural creation and reflect Victorian fears about uncontrolled female agency.</p>
    <p>Bella‚Äôs sexuality, even in her earliest stages of development, is presented as both instinctual and unnerving. Though allegedly childlike in mind, she retains physical memories of adult sexuality, a paradox that both fascinates and repels McCandless. He desires her for her innocence but fears her for her sexual appetite. Her characterization functions as a projection of male Victorian anxieties‚Äîparticularly the fear of liberated, sexually autonomous women. Duncan Wedderburn, in particular, is destabilized by Bella‚Äôs independence; his obsession with controlling her sexually leads to emotional collapse.</p>
    <p>Victoria‚Äôs letter, however, demolishes the constructed myth of Bella Baxter. She clarifies that she never lost her memory, was never reanimated, and was never a blank slate. Instead, she is a woman who fled an abusive marriage and, under Godwin Baxter‚Äôs protection, took on a new identity to shield herself from scandal. Victoria‚Äôs transformation into Bella is not medical‚Äîit is strategic. She uses the identity as a space of reinvention, reclaiming control over her body, mind, and future.</p>

    <h3>Archibald McCandless</h3>
    <p>Archibald McCandless, Bella/Victoria‚Äôs husband and primary narrator of the novel, is a deeply unreliable storyteller. He constructs an elaborate myth in which he plays the role of compassionate husband, humble doctor, and open-minded supporter of female independence. Yet throughout his account, cracks in this self-image are apparent.</p>
    <p>McCandless is drawn to Bella in part because of her childlike innocence. He distinguishes himself from Godwin by claiming moral superiority, yet both are fascinated by Bella‚Äôs supposed purity. His attraction rests on a fantasy of controllable womanhood: a partner who is dependent, sexually curious but na√Øve, and shaped in his image. He repeatedly insists that he accepts Bella‚Äôs affairs and eccentricities, but his narrative tone betrays wounded pride and possessiveness.</p>
    <p>Victoria‚Äôs letter reveals a far more damning portrait. She describes McCandless as weak-willed, unambitious, and emotionally dependent. He resents her social confidence, her sexuality, and her professional success. Rather than confronting this resentment directly, he rewrites her life through the Bella narrative, stripping her of her history, intellect, and agency. By transforming her into a fabricated experiment, he becomes her origin‚Äîand thus her superior.</p>
    <p>Moreover, McCandless‚Äôs personal politics are rooted in individualism. While Victoria pushes for social reform and public health infrastructure, McCandless is satisfied having climbed out of poverty himself. He is a portrait of Victorian liberalism: well-meaning, but limited by self-interest and ego. His story masquerades as feminist, but in truth it is a colonization of his wife‚Äôs voice and body. He is not the ally he imagines himself to be‚Äîhe is a gatekeeper posing as a savior.</p>

    <h3>Godwin Baxter</h3>
    <p>Godwin Baxter serves as both the moral anchor and intellectual catalyst of the novel. In McCandless‚Äôs account, he is grotesque‚Äîan ogre-like figure who, due to physical deformity, is denied normal social and professional participation. As such, he practices experimental medicine in secret and devotes himself to caring for the poor and animals. He is presented as Bella‚Äôs literal creator, raising immediate parallels with Victor Frankenstein.</p>
    <p>According to McCandless, Godwin created Bella from the corpse of a drowned woman and a transplanted infant brain. His motivations, though couched in altruism, are rooted in loneliness and desire. McCandless portrays Godwin as yearning for a female companion who will love him without judgment. Yet Bella, in his telling, rejects Godwin‚Äôs paternalism, leaving McCandless to triumph as her true partner.</p>
    <p>In Victoria‚Äôs letter, Godwin is rehumanized. Rather than a monstrous doctor, he is a kind, reserved man whose very ordinariness makes him exceptional. He does not reanimate Victoria‚Äîhe shelters and educates her. While he refuses romantic involvement, Victoria falls in love with him and remains emotionally loyal to him for the rest of her life. Godwin is the only man in the narrative who supports her ambitions without seeking control.</p>
    <p>Crucially, Victoria hints that McCandless may have been more enamored with Godwin than he admits. He imitates Godwin‚Äôs ethics, idolizes his intellect, and may even project aspects of his desire onto Bella as a conduit for his admiration. The fact that Godwin never introduces McCandless to his mother, Mrs. Dinwiddie‚Äîwhom McCandless mistakes for a housekeeper‚Äîunderscores that Godwin did not consider McCandless a trusted confidant. The subtle exclusion speaks volumes about social status, personal loyalty, and McCandless‚Äôs failure to see people as they are.</p>

    <h3>Duncan Wedderburn</h3>
    <p>Duncan Wedderburn, a Glasgow lawyer, appears in both McCandless‚Äôs and Victoria‚Äôs accounts with significant variation. In McCandless‚Äôs version, he is a libertine, a gambler, and a morally compromised man whose relationship with Bella reflects obsessive jealousy, sexual fixation, and eventual psychological collapse. Duncan is another example of Victorian masculinity buckling under the weight of female autonomy.</p>
    <p>Like McCandless, Duncan cannot reconcile Bella‚Äôs beauty with her sexual freedom. He is attracted to working-class women, believing they are less judgmental and more physically accepting. Bella‚Äôs mix of class grace and erotic openness fascinates him, but when she refuses to be tamed, he implodes. McCandless‚Äôs depiction of Duncan is almost gleefully tragic‚Äîhe is a foil meant to elevate McCandless‚Äôs own ‚Äútolerance.‚Äù</p>
    <p>Victoria‚Äôs recollection is far less dramatic. She notes that Duncan was one of Godwin‚Äôs acquaintances and her occasional theater companion. She eloped with him not because she loved him, but because she was curious. He, on the other hand, wanted more from her. Their misaligned expectations led to his breakdown, but Victoria refrains from condemnation. Her account is grounded and realistic, stripping away McCandless‚Äôs melodramatic narrative flourishes to reveal a man who was fragile, not monstrous.</p>

    <h3>Characters Who Shape Bella‚Äôs Political Awakening</h3>
    <p>During her travels with Duncan, Bella encounters figures who influence her understanding of politics, power, and ideology. Among the most prominent are Dr. Hooker and Mr. Astley, two men who engage her in philosophical debate but ultimately attempt to control the terms of her education.</p>
    <p>Hooker, an American Protestant missionary, views Bella‚Äôs innocence as something to be corrected. He exposes her to colonial violence, hoping to ‚Äúmature‚Äù her into a worldview where empire and suffering are necessary evils. Astley, by contrast, is a fatalistic Malthusian who insists that suffering is inevitable and that women can only create change through domestic roles. Both men are emblematic of patriarchal didacticism: they don‚Äôt want Bella to think‚Äîthey want her to think like them.</p>
    <p>Other travel companions include a Russian gambler, who tries to protect Bella from Duncan‚Äôs recklessness but conflates Scotland with England‚Äîan ironic commentary on national erasure and imperialism. In Madame Cronquebil, Bella finds initial sympathy but eventual betrayal, as Cronquebil profits off Bella‚Äôs labor in the Paris brothel. Only Toinette, a fellow sex worker and socialist, offers Bella genuine camaraderie and shared values. None of these characters appear in Victoria‚Äôs final letter, reinforcing that while they influenced Bella‚Äôs political consciousness, they were ultimately transient.</p>

    <h3>Victoria‚Äôs Father and General Blessington</h3>
    <p>Victoria‚Äôs father, Blaydon Hattersley, and her first husband, Sir Aubrey de la Pole Blessington, embody the rigid expectations and patriarchal brutality of Victorian family life. Hattersley sees his daughter‚Äôs value only in economic terms. He withholds money, controls her education, and physically abuses her. He is disgusted by her pregnancy and is uninterested in her well-being‚Äîhis role in both narratives is one of dominance and disinterest.</p>
    <p>General Blessington, though initially portrayed by McCandless as a Victorian patriarch undone by scandal, is far more sinister. He marries Victoria expecting purity and compliance but refuses to meet her emotional or physical needs. When she shows sexual desire, he deems her mentally ill and withholds intimacy. Later, he impregnates a young servant girl and refuses to take responsibility. In both McCandless‚Äôs and Victoria‚Äôs accounts, Blessington‚Äôs hypocrisy is exposed‚Äîespecially when Bella identifies him as ‚ÄúMonsieur Spankybot,‚Äù a masked brothel client. His death by suicide is not tragic but symbolic: a collapse of the oppressive order he represents.</p>

    <h3>Alasdair Gray and Michael Donnelly</h3>
    <p>Alasdair Gray, though the author of Poor Things, inserts himself into the narrative as a fictional editor who becomes part of the novel‚Äôs elaborate metafictional structure. He claims to have received McCandless‚Äôs manuscript from historian Michael Donnelly and to have edited it with minimal interference‚Äîyet his footnotes and commentary betray clear bias.</p>
    <p>Gray sides with McCandless, believing his Gothic, mythologized account over Victoria‚Äôs clear-eyed testimony. Like McCandless, he is fascinated by Bella as an object, not as a subject. He projects his beliefs onto the narrative, interpreting Victoria‚Äôs refutations as delusions rather than challenges to patriarchal authority. His editorial presence becomes an extension of the very system Victoria is fighting against.</p>
    <p>Donnelly, though absent in voice, serves as a counterpoint. He believes Victoria‚Äôs account is more credible and urges skepticism toward McCandless‚Äôs version. His role is crucial: he introduces doubt, invites scrutiny, and subtly allies the reader with Victoria. The interplay between Gray and Donnelly is Poor Things at its most postmodern, reminding us that truth is often shaped by who holds the pen.</p>
