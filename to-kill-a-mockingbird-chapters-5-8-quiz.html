    question: "What is Miss Maudie Atkinson's favorite pastime?",
    acceptableAnswers: ["gardening"],
    explanation: "Miss Maudie is frequently described as tending to her flowers and taking great pride in them, symbolizing her care, vitality, and independence.",

  {
    type: "long-answer",
    question: "Describe how Boo Radley begins to shift from a figure of fear to a figure of mystery and compassion in Chapters 5–8. Use specific examples from the text to support your response.",
    modelAnswer: "In Chapters 5–8, Boo Radley begins to emerge as a more human and kind figure, moving away from the monstrous rumors the children believe. Miss Maudie provides a more empathetic account of his past, calling him polite and hinting that his isolation stems from his father's religious fanaticism. Boo's quiet acts of kindness, such as mending Jem's pants and leaving gifts in the knothole, suggest a desire for connection. The most direct gesture is when he places a blanket over Scout's shoulders during Miss Maudie's house fire, showing protective instincts and contradicting his fearful reputation.",

  },
  {
    type: "true-false",
    question: "Miss Maudie is devastated and bitter after her house burns down.",
    correctAnswer: false,
