    question: "What is Miss Maudie Atkinson's favorite pastime?",
    acceptableAnswers: ["gardening"],
    explanation: "Miss Maudie is frequently described as tending to her flowers and taking great pride in them, symbolizing her care, vitality, and independence.",
    hint: "Scout often sees her in the yard with flowers."
  },
  {
    type: "long-answer",
    question: "Describe how Boo Radley begins to shift from a figure of fear to a figure of mystery and compassion in Chapters 5–8. Use specific examples from the text to support your response.",
    modelAnswer: "In Chapters 5–8, Boo Radley begins to emerge as a more human and kind figure, moving away from the monstrous rumors the children believe. Miss Maudie provides a more empathetic account of his past, calling him polite and hinting that his isolation stems from his father's religious fanaticism. Boo's quiet acts of kindness, such as mending Jem's pants and leaving gifts in the knothole, suggest a desire for connection. The most direct gesture is when he places a blanket over Scout's shoulders during Miss Maudie's house fire, showing protective instincts and contradicting his fearful reputation.",
    hint: "Think about how Boo *acts* versus how people *talk* about him."
  },

  },
  {
    type: "true-false",
    question: "Jem retrieves his pants from the Radley fence and finds them mended and folded.",
    correctAnswer: true,
    explanation: "This is a key moment that alters Jem’s view of Boo Radley. Boo’s actions demonstrate kindness, mystery, and forethought, which challenges previous assumptions about him.",
    hint: "Jem is surprised by what he finds when he sneaks out that night."
  },
  {
    type: "true-false",
    question: "Miss Maudie is devastated and bitter after her house burns down.",
    correctAnswer: false,
    explanation: "Miss Maudie remains optimistic and even cheerful, focusing on the opportunity to rebuild and have more space for gardening. Her resilience reflects the moral strength emphasized in the novel.",
    hint: "Think about her reaction the morning after the fire."

      "For attempting to leave a note for Boo Radley",
      "For skipping school"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "For attempting to leave a note for Boo Radley",
    explanations: {
      "For building a snowman that looked like Mr. Avery": "Incorrect. A is from Chapter 8.",
      "For playing with matches near the Radley house": "Incorrect. B never occurs.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: "He says the tree is dying",

      "He wants to teach the children a lesson": "Incorrect. B is not mentioned.",
