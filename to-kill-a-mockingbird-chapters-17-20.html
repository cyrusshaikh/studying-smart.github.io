<strong>Chapter 17</strong>
The trial of Tom Robinson begins with Sheriff Heck Tate as the first witness. Tate recounts how Bob Ewell summoned him on November 21st, leading him to find Mayella Ewell battered on the floor of their home near the town dump. Mayella accused Tom Robinson of assaulting and raping her. Tate admits that no doctor was called to examine Mayella, and he briefly describes her injuries, noting bruises concentrated on the right side of her face.

Bob Ewell testifies next, presenting himself as the indignant father defending his daughter’s honor. Scout observes his filthy appearance, highlighting the squalor in which the Ewells live. Despite their dire living conditions, Mayella’s potted geraniums stand out—a fragile attempt at beauty amidst the surrounding poverty. Ewell claims to have witnessed Tom Robinson attacking Mayella and emphasizes that a doctor wasn’t necessary because, as he says, he “saw who did it.”

Atticus, through his cross-examination, carefully exposes contradictions. He confirms that no medical examination took place, undermining the prosecution’s credibility. Then, Atticus asks Bob Ewell to write his name. Ewell reveals he is left-handed, which suggests that he, rather than Tom—whose left hand is crippled—was likely responsible for Mayella’s injuries.

<strong>Chapter 17 Analysis</strong>
This chapter carefully lays the groundwork for dismantling the Ewells’ story. The absence of medical evidence speaks volumes, introducing doubt into the case. Bob Ewell’s left-handedness becomes a significant detail that casts suspicion on his testimony and highlights Atticus’s methodical approach. The chapter also paints a vivid portrait of Mayella’s environment, suggesting that her desperation may stem from her isolation and poverty, setting the stage for the emotional complexities that follow.

<strong>Chapter 18</strong>
Mayella Ewell takes the stand next. In sharp contrast to her father’s unkempt appearance, she is dressed with deliberate care, as though attempting to present herself as credible and respectable. Mayella is immediately uncomfortable and resentful, perceiving Atticus’s politeness as mockery—a reflection of her unfamiliarity with respectful treatment.

Atticus questions Mayella gently but persistently, exposing the inconsistencies in her story. She reveals her loneliness, her role as caretaker for her siblings, and the absence of any friendships. When Atticus asks about her father’s behavior, particularly when he drinks, her evasive answers hint at domestic abuse. As Mayella describes the events of November 21st, her version of the story begins to unravel under Atticus’s scrutiny. She contradicts herself multiple times, especially regarding whether Tom struck her.

When Tom stands to be identified, the entire courtroom sees that his left arm is essentially useless, rendering it impossible for him to have inflicted Mayella’s injuries as described. Feeling cornered, Mayella lashes out emotionally, accusing the courtroom of cruelty toward her.

<strong>Chapter 18 Analysis</strong>
Mayella’s testimony reveals the crushing weight of her circumstances. Her resentment toward Atticus’s civility underscores how deeply she’s internalized neglect and mistreatment. Atticus skillfully exposes not only the flaws in her testimony but also the silent tragedy of her life: a lonely girl trapped by poverty, ignorance, and abuse. Her contradictory statements, paired with Tom’s physical disability, point unmistakably toward her father as the true source of violence. The courtroom dynamic here also highlights how Mayella, though a false accuser, is both a perpetrator and a victim—a product of the racial and patriarchal oppression surrounding her.

<strong>Chapter 19</strong>
Tom Robinson testifies in his own defense, offering a narrative completely at odds with Mayella’s. He explains that Mayella often invited him into the yard to help with small chores, which he agreed to do out of kindness. On the day in question, she sent her siblings away to purchase ice cream and lured Tom inside. She then made romantic advances toward him, embracing him and attempting to kiss him. At that moment, Bob Ewell appeared, cursing and threatening both of them. Terrified, Tom fled.

As Tom speaks, Scout reflects on Mayella’s profound isolation. Caught between white society that shuns her and Black society that cannot associate with her, Mayella exists in a lonely limbo, where even a simple act of kindness like Tom’s becomes perilous.

During cross-examination, the prosecutor, Mr. Gilmer, goads Tom into admitting that he felt sorry for Mayella—a statement that horrifies the courtroom. A Black man expressing pity for a white woman crosses the rigid boundaries of Maycomb’s racial hierarchy. The weight of that single phrase seals the unspoken verdict in the minds of many jurors.

Dill becomes physically sick from watching Mr. Gilmer’s condescending interrogation and leaves the courtroom, accompanied by Scout. Outside, Dill explains that he can’t stomach the way Tom is being treated, revealing his innate sense of justice.

<strong>Chapter 19 Analysis</strong>
Tom Robinson’s testimony is the emotional heart of the trial. His version of events reveals a tragic mix of human loneliness, desperation, and cruelty. The social taboos of Maycomb render Tom guilty the moment he expresses sympathy for Mayella. His attempt to do right by her becomes his downfall, as the rigid racial codes view his kindness as an offense to white supremacy. Dill’s breakdown reflects the moral clarity children often possess, recognizing cruelty where adults see only custom. This chapter is not just a legal battle—it is a brutal exposure of how deeply racism corrupts justice.

<strong>Chapter 20</strong>
After leaving the courtroom, Scout and Dill encounter Dolphus Raymond, a man who lives on the fringes of Maycomb society due to his interracial marriage. Known for drinking from a paper bag, Raymond explains that his drunken act is merely a cover; he pretends to drink alcohol to give townspeople a reason for his unconventional life. In reality, he drinks only Coca-Cola. By presenting himself as a drunk, he allows others to rationalize his choices, thus avoiding more serious social condemnation.

Raymond sympathizes with Dill’s discomfort, sharing that Maycomb’s deep-seated racism is unbearable for those who see it clearly. His character challenges the town’s assumptions about morality and decency, revealing how much of Maycomb’s social order is built on hypocrisy.

Scout and Dill return to the courtroom as Atticus delivers his closing argument. Atticus appeals to the jury’s conscience, emphasizing that the court system should be the one place where all men are equal. He exposes the prosecution’s complete lack of evidence and highlights the racial prejudice underlying the accusations against Tom Robinson. His impassioned speech reaches its climax as Calpurnia quietly enters the courtroom.

<strong>Chapter 20 Analysis</strong>
Dolphus Raymond’s deception exposes the toxic conformity of Maycomb’s moral code. His private rebellion against societal expectations shows that those who defy the status quo often survive only by cloaking their defiance. His conversation with Dill and Scout serves as a sobering lesson that the ugliness of racism is visible even to children who have not yet been fully conditioned by society’s rules.

Atticus’s speech is one of the novel’s most powerful moments. His appeal to justice is not just about Tom Robinson—it is an indictment of the entire system that allows racial bias to override truth. His calm yet passionate tone embodies moral courage, but the reader—and Atticus—already sense the likely futility of his plea. The tension between law and social prejudice reaches its apex here, driving home the novel’s central tragedy.
