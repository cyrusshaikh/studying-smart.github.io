    <h2 id="ch7-10">üìñ Chapters 7‚Äì10 Summary</h2>
    <p>Fifteen months have passed since McCandless last saw Bella or Godwin. In the meantime, McCandless has qualified as a doctor, supported by a modest inheritance from his late father. But despite this professional success, his personal life feels empty. Then, during a walk in Kelvingrove Park, he unexpectedly comes across the Baxters.</p>
    <p>Bella appears transformed‚Äîmore mature, confident, and physically radiant. Her speech, though still peculiar, is more fluid, and McCandless estimates her mental age to be that of an early adolescent, around 12 or 13. Godwin, in contrast, is visibly drained. His face is drawn and weary, suggesting deep emotional exhaustion.</p>
    <p>Bella greets McCandless warmly and leads him away from Godwin, who she affectionately calls ‚ÄúGod,‚Äù encouraging him to rest. She pulls McCandless into a secluded bush, where they engage in a vaguely described but clearly sexual encounter. Bella treats it with nonchalance, casually sharing that she has had similar experiences with others‚Äîmen and women alike.</p>
    <p>McCandless, stunned and increasingly infatuated, abruptly proposes marriage. Bella playfully ignores the suggestion. When he hesitantly asks whether she‚Äôs been intimate with Godwin, Bella replies no‚Äîand says that‚Äôs the reason for Godwin‚Äôs unhappiness. When they return to the bench, Bella announces to Godwin that she and McCandless are to be married.</p>
    <p>The emotional blow triggers something primal in Godwin. He lets out a deafening, unnatural scream so intense it renders Bella unconscious and McCandless momentarily senseless. The scream seems to rupture his very being: afterward, his voice, once shrill, becomes deep and resonant.</p>

    <h2>üìñ Chapter 8 Summary: ‚ÄúThe Engagement‚Äù</h2>
    <p>Godwin is devastated by the engagement but ultimately gives his reluctant blessing. Bella tries to comfort him by suggesting that the three of them live together after she marries McCandless. She declares herself to be a romantic and highly sexual woman, but explains that she has no desire for Godwin because he continues to treat her as a child.</p>
    <p>Godwin, wounded but composed, proposes a two-week separation so he can prepare emotionally. Bella agrees, though for her, the idea of waiting ‚Äúa fortnight‚Äù feels like an eternity. McCandless promises to write her daily and gives her a pearl pin as a sign of devotion.</p>
    <p>He does write‚Äîpassionately and frequently. Bella replies only once with a cryptic, childlike note written without vowels. The silence gnaws at McCandless, until one day he receives a desperate letter from Godwin.</p>
    <p>Godwin writes that Bella plans to elope with Duncan Wedderburn, a morally corrupt lawyer whom Godwin had hired to draw up a will. Duncan, it seems, has seduced Bella during the past three nights. Though appalled, McCandless learns that Bella is not defenseless: she understands the mechanics of contraception. Still, Godwin begs McCandless to intervene.</p>

    <h2>üìñ Chapter 9 Summary: ‚ÄúAt the Window‚Äù</h2>
    <p>McCandless hurries to confront Bella. She greets him with her usual honesty and cheer. To her, their six-day separation has felt like years. She insists that she still intends to marry him‚Äîbut also wants to run off with Duncan for the time being. In her view, there‚Äôs no contradiction.</p>
    <p>Bella explains that she craves new experiences. Lacking a past of her own, she feels an urgent need to create one. McCandless pleads with her to reconsider; he sees Duncan as predatory and morally unfit. Bella listens, but remains firm in her decision.</p>
    <p>She then promises McCandless a surprise and leads him upstairs. He waits outside her bedroom, hopeful and anxious‚Äîwondering if she intends to seduce him. Instead, Bella sneaks up behind him and chloroforms him, knocking him unconscious.</p>

    <h2>üìñ Chapter 10 Summary: ‚ÄúWithout Bella‚Äù</h2>
    <p>McCandless awakens to the news that Bella has eloped with Duncan. Her knowledge of chloroform came from assisting Godwin at his veterinary clinic.</p>
    <p>Godwin is a wreck. He reveals that he was in the middle of rewriting his will to leave everything to Bella, whom he believes gave his life meaning. Now, with her gone, he is consumed by regret. He wishes he had never placed the fetus‚Äôs brain inside a woman‚Äôs body. Had he raised the child normally, as a foster daughter, she would have stayed with him for years. Instead, driven by ‚Äúdamnable sexual appetites,‚Äù he compressed her childhood into a grotesque fast-forward.</p>
    <p>McCandless tries to offer some hope: Bella, despite being only two and a half years old, is incredibly intelligent, observant, and resilient. She may lack life experience, but she is no fool. Godwin quietly confesses that he arranged for money to be hidden in her coat so she could escape Duncan if she needed to.</p>
    <p>Still, McCandless is deeply disturbed by Bella‚Äôs immature understanding of time. Her perception of events‚Äîpast, present, and future‚Äîis warped. She talks of being engaged to McCandless and eloping with Duncan as if the two events can coexist. It‚Äôs this temporal confusion, more than anything, that makes her unpredictable.</p>
    <p>McCandless and Godwin move in together, mourning and waiting. Days later, a telegram arrives. Bella has made it to London‚Äîwith Duncan.</p>

    <h2>üîç Analysis & Interpretation</h2>

    <h3>Bella‚Äôs Growth and the Crisis of Identity</h3>
    <p>These chapters showcase Bella as a paradox: she is mentally adolescent, emotionally chaotic, and physically mature. Her development is rapid, but nonlinear. She speaks with confidence, craves knowledge and experience, and actively explores her sexuality‚Äîbut her understanding of time, loyalty, and consequence is deeply underdeveloped. This creates a central tension: Is Bella a liberated woman, or a dangerously accelerated child?</p>
    <p>Her dual behavior reflects Gray‚Äôs challenge to Victorian (and modern) ideas of ‚Äúwomanhood.‚Äù Is femininity something innate‚Äîor something shaped, distorted, and projected by the expectations of men?</p>

    <h3>Godwin‚Äôs Collapse: From Creator to Regretful Parent</h3>
    <p>Godwin‚Äôs transformation is tragic. For all his scientific brilliance, he is emotionally naive. He believed he could create love through anatomical alchemy. But Bella is not a compliant invention‚Äîshe is her own becoming, a fusion of chaos, instinct, and potential.</p>
    <p>His scream in Chapter 7 is symbolic. It is the sound of paternal grief, male jealousy, and scientific hubris crashing all at once. And his later confession‚Äîwishing he had simply raised the baby‚Äîmarks the emotional turning point of his character. He is no longer the detached surgeon. He is a broken man who realizes he wanted family, not fame.</p>

    <h3>McCandless: Possession vs. Partnership</h3>
    <p>McCandless is caught between genuine love and patriarchal impulse. He wants to marry Bella, but also control her. He is shocked by her autonomy, especially her sexual openness. His jealousy of Duncan and horror at Bella‚Äôs choices reveal his underlying belief that, once engaged, she should belong to him.</p>
    <p>His view of Bella is idealized and infantilized at once: he sees her as both a lover and a wounded creature who needs guidance. But Bella resists all such roles.</p>

    <h3>Time as a Theme</h3>
    <p>Bella‚Äôs warped sense of time is one of the most brilliant literary devices in Poor Things. She compresses emotional timelines, mixes past and present, and treats contradictory commitments as equally valid. This reflects her unnatural origin but also serves as a metaphor for trauma, growth, and the subjectivity of experience.</p>
    <p>Time in this novel does not heal‚Äîit distorts. Bella‚Äôs sense of it governs her decisions, confuses others, and challenges readers to rethink how we measure maturity.</p>

    <h3>Sex, Power, and Responsibility</h3>
    <p>These chapters are steeped in discomfort, and rightly so. Gray asks: What happens when sexuality emerges in someone whose identity is still forming? Who is responsible for protecting‚Äîor exploiting‚Äîthat person? Bella‚Äôs behavior is unsettling, but so is the behavior of every man around her. Each wants something from her‚Äîlove, affection, obedience, meaning.</p>
    <p>She, in contrast, wants only to live. To see, to feel, to roam. She is not evil. She is simply unfinished‚Äîand unwilling to be anyone‚Äôs experiment.</p>
