    <h1>Exercise 4</h1>

    <p>In this question, we're asked to suggest five variables that could be used to evaluate and rank cities for living and working. Keep in mind that answers may vary depending on personal preferences or priorities.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Housing Costs:</strong> The average price of apartments or houses. Expensive housing makes it harder for people to afford living there, which may lower a city's ranking.</li>
      <li><strong>Unemployment Rate:</strong> A high unemployment rate suggests fewer job opportunities, making a city less desirable for work and possibly lowering its rank.</li>
      <li><strong>Availability of Healthcare:</strong> Measured by the number of doctors per 1,000 residents. Fewer doctors often means poorer access to healthcare, reducing a city’s appeal.</li>
      <li><strong>Population Size:</strong> The total number of people living in the city. A higher population may reflect the city's popularity or available opportunities, but could also create challenges depending on resources.</li>
      <li><strong>Population Density:</strong> The number of people per square mile (or kilometer). Density affects quality of life — very high density may indicate crowded conditions, while moderate density may reflect better space and infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="result">
      Sample Variables: Housing cost, Unemployment rate, Number of doctors per 1000 people, Population size, Population density.
