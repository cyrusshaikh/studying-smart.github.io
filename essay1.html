    <h1>Essay 1: Constructed Bodies, Controlled Minds</h1>
    <p><em>This essay explores how <strong>Poor Things</strong> critiques patriarchal institutions by analyzing how female bodies and minds are controlled, infantilized, and redefined through legal, scientific, and social systems. Bella Baxter's story becomes a revolutionary act of female authorship and resistance.</em></p>

    <p>In <strong>Poor Things</strong>, Alasdair Gray constructs a scathing indictment of patriarchal society through the lens of Bella Baxter, a woman whose life, body, and mind become sites of ideological warfare. Set in a fantastical yet eerily familiar 19th-century Glasgow, the novel merges speculative fiction with political satire to dismantle the social, legal, and sexual hierarchies of its time. Bella’s body becomes the battleground for competing male narratives — scientific, romantic, religious, and legal — that attempt to define her identity, purpose, and limits. Through Bella’s struggle for self-definition, Gray unearths the historical mechanisms by which women have been infantilized, sexualized, institutionalized, and silenced. This essay argues that <em>Poor Things</em> uses Bella’s creation, treatment, and rebellion to reveal how patriarchal institutions preserve power by denying women agency over their bodies and minds — and in doing so, it reimagines female liberation as an act of radical authorship.</p>

    <p>Gray’s parody of scientific progress begins with Bella’s resurrection — not as a miracle, but a violation.</p>
<p>“”</p>
<p>This grotesque confession positions Bella not as a medical marvel, but as a reconstructed fantasy — a woman with a child’s mind crafted to satisfy patriarchal desire. Her body is not saved; it is rewritten to serve. Gray makes clear that even benevolent institutions like science can be tools of control when dominated by unchecked male power.</p>

<p>The novel continues its critique through the language of infantilization. Bella is often denied agency under the guise of care and protection.</p>
<p>“”</p>
<p>This supposed diagnosis reduces her to a child, stripping her of voice and authority. She is spoken for, spoken about, and legally manipulated.</p>
<p>“”</p>
<p>Such lines showcase the paternalistic attitudes embedded in Victorian ideology — ideologies still echoed today. When women are declared too innocent, too fragile, or too emotional to participate in public discourse, their silence becomes institutionalized.</p>

<p>“”</p>
<p>This paradoxical test of sanity illustrates how psychiatric authority is wielded as a weapon. Bella’s refusal to conform is not considered reasoned dissent but pathological deviance.</p>

<p>“”</p>
<p>Despite her imposed innocence, Bella burns with awareness. This fury is not madness — it is insight. It is the moral clarity that Gray assigns to those who see through social deception.</p>

<p>“”</p>
<p>Bella’s background reveals how both ends of the social spectrum conspire to condition women into servitude. Whether as wife, mistress, or maiden, her worth is filtered through male expectation.</p>
  <p>Male panic over female sexuality peaks when one character claims that "the touch of a female body arouses DIABOLICAL LUSTS in potent sensual males... Cuddlin! The word is disgustin and unmanly" (217–218). This quote satirizes the way patriarchal societies externalize male desire, placing the burden of restraint and blame on women. A similar attitude is expressed in the claim that "No normal healthy woman – no good or sane woman wants or expects to enjoy sexual contact, except as a duty" (218), revealing how female desire is demonized and twisted into moral failure.</p>

<p>The law mirrors this pathology. When Bella’s husband insists, "If she is now sane she will come with me. If she refuses she is still mad" (219), the implication is clear: resistance is treated as insanity. The system is rigged so that any deviation from patriarchal norms can be redefined as illness or sin. Marriage and madness become indistinguishable forms of control.</p>

<p>Bella’s clarity grows alongside her rage. In one of her most revealing reflections, she notes: "Both [the scullery maid and master’s daughter] are used by other people. They are allowed to decide nothing for themselves" (263). This powerful line collapses class boundaries, positioning all women as subjects under male control. It also represents Bella’s evolution — not merely reacting, but diagnosing the structural nature of female oppression.</p>

<p>Ultimately, <em>Poor Things</em> is not just a critique of Victorian patriarchy — it is a reclamation of authorship. Bella’s story, full of contradictions and rewrites, becomes a metaphor for female identity: overwritten, questioned, and yet defiant. As Bella herself says, "Mother had taught me to be a working man’s domestic slave; the nuns taught me to be a rich man’s domestic toy" (333). Gray uses Bella not only to expose these dynamics but to imagine a new kind of heroine — one who is fragmented, angry, and ultimately free to speak for herself. In reclaiming her narrative, Bella becomes the author of her own liberation.</p>
